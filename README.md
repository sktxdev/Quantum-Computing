My technique for learning.
Watch a video on the topic I'm interested on, and do a deep dive if I dont understand something, until I'm satisfyed with my knowledge, then resurface and continue. Sometimes this can turn into as little as one slide or a couple of minutes of watching a segment of the video and a couple of days of filling in background knowledge.


## General

For code editing I'll try to add juypter notebooks, but will use vscode for editing things like readme's and gitignore etc.,. 

If you wish to contribute on the markdown (this file), feel free to do so. I recommend a markdown previewer such as Markdown Preview Enhanced if you're using vscode.
